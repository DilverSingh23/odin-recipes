                <li>1 cup warm water (105 degrees F)</li>
                <li>1 Tablespoon granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1 Tablespoon active dry yeast</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <h4>Make The Pizza Dough:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine warm water, yeast and sugar in a large mixing bowl and stir to 
                combine.</li>
            <li>Let mixture sit for 5 minutes, or until it becomes frothy and bubbles form.</li>
            <li>Gently stir in olive oil.</li>
            <li>Add 2 cups of flour and salt and mix with a spatula until a ball 
                begins to form (dough will still be slightly sticky). Add more flour 
                as needed to form a dough ball.</li>
            <li>Transfer to a floured surface and knead into a smooth dough, 
                adding up to ½ cup extra flour if needed.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Make The Pizza:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Put a pizza stone in the oven and preheat the oven to 500 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Roll out the pizza dough to a 14” circle on a piece of parchment paper 
                (for easy transfer to the pizza stone).</li>
            <li>Spread pizza sauce evenly over the dough.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce.</li>
            <li>Use a pizza peel to transfer the pizza on the parchment paper onto the 
                baking stone in the oven.</li>
            <li>Bake the pizza in the preheated oven for 10-14 minutes, or until the 
                crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted.</li>
            <li>Remove the pizza from the oven (using the pizza peel) and transfer it 
                to a wire rack to cool for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cut with pizza scissors or transfer to a large cutting board and use a 
                pizza cutter and serve.</li>
        </ol>
